# brickwrecker
We were to ask to create a game for or project assignment for object oriented programming and i, Zam Izzatty Qaisara(18002437)paired up with farzana Athirah and finally decided to make a simple brickwrecker as our choice of game after discussing and changing our mind for several time. As students, there were a lot of obstacle for us to create this game but we tried to make some other initiative to gain our knowledge such as watching and doing tutorials from platforms such as google and youtube. As for that we managed to create our simple brick wrecker game.
This project consist of a ball, bricks , borders in every postion and a paddle . Basically user will need to move the paddle using the left and right button on the keyboard and make sure the ball wont fall and continues to hit the bricks until it successfully wrecks all the bricks. There are score given and if the ball falls then 'game over' will be shown
